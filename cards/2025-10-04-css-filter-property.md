# CSS filter Property: blur, brightness, contrast, and Visual Effects

CSS filter effects provide visual effects without the need to use photo editing software. Instead of using software like Photoshop to edit a picture, the software only required
is the user's browser. Using the `filter` property allows for the application of effects such as blur, brightness, and contrast. These effects are applied directly to the element. Filters can also be applied to text and layered on top of each other. The `blur()` effect makes an image blurry and hard to see, while `brightness()` makes the image appear brighter or darker. `contrast()` increases the contrast of an image.

## When to use

Use when wanting to add a filter to a picture or text without the need of photo editing software such as Photoshop.
