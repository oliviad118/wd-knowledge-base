# CSS animation Property: Timing Duration, and Iteration

The `animation` property is a shorthand CSS property that applies animation between styles. Properties that the `animation` property contains include `animation-timing-function`, `animation-iteration-count`, and `animation-duration`. The `animation-timing-function` depicts how an animation should play out during its progression. `animation-iteration-count` determines how many times an animation should play before stopping, while `animation-duration` sets the amount of time an animation should take for one play through. The `animation` property shorthand makes it simpler to add in these functions by allowing you to set all animation properties at once.

## Example

```css
animation: 5s linear 3s 2 slide in; 
```

## When to Use

Use when wanting to include an animation on a webpage. Considerations for accesibility should be taken into account when including animations, as they can trigger disorders such as epilepsy, migraine, and Vestibular disorders.
